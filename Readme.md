## EDA on TripAdvisor dataset

Siddhesh Tiwari

#### Description
The aim of this project was to do an exploratory data analysis on the Trip advisor dataset. The code involves a data scrubbing part wherein I had to scrub the JSON files 
and parse the hotel names, cities and countries where they were located. After this I summarized the dataset on various factors to get insights.
